# Final Project

**Title:** Mountain Application Manager  
**Name:** Joseph McCole
**Student ID:** G00361784

## Application Function

Discuss, in detail, what the application does. Add a screenshot image of the application in use (See example of image added below). 

This application is intended for a mountain climber, it will give details on the height, walk duration and mountain Id of a particlular mountain that the user can manipulate with the buttons i added.  
## Running the Application

Provide step by step instructions on how to run your application. Are there any software installs required? 

```MARKDOWN
List the instructions step by step
    1. Open the repository in codespaces
    2. Install Extension Pack for Java
    3. Open the Main class
    4. Click on the run icon on the top right
            :
```

## Minimum Project Requirements

Confirm and demonstrate how you have met all minimum project requirements:

* The project, including code and documentation, will be fully contained in the provided Git Classroom repo.

    For this assignment i fully coded in github codespaces and ran the code in the codespaces browser.

* The project must contain a working JavaFX GUI which manages items of your choice.

    The Gui I developed included buttons that managed the list items that were aslo added to the arraylist in mounatain manager.


* The GUI must at minimum provide access to all 7 methods implemented in the Student Manager App.
* Methods = Load DB, Add Item, Delete Item, Find item by ID/Name, Show total items, Save to DB, Quit.

    All the above named methods have neen handled in some respect in my code, the desired functionality is there.

* The code MUST compile. 30% grade reduction if code does not compile.

    Code is compiling as of 16/12/23, no futher changes are to be made.

* The application code must be formatted in a consistent and standard way.

    Left click and format documnet has been performed on all the classes.

* The code must contain comments. One comment per class, method and variable at minimum.

    Commenting has been performed.
* There must be two commits per week minimum (Note: Should be many commits per day coding).

    Two commits per week has been performed.

* The documentation and commentary must be free of a grammar and spelling mistakes.

    Comments are free of grammer and spelling mistakes.

## Project Requirments above and beyond

Discuss any application features or design elements that show you went above and beyond basic requirments.

    I added an image at the top of the GUI.
    I added a List to the GUI that updates when the desired button is pressed
    I Styled the GUI.


## JavaFX

Discuss the GUI design used. Discuss why you chose this design and any features you thing make your application stands out.

For this assignement i created a basic javafx layout based on centering the items. I also added a list to appp that updates based on interaction from the user.

## Roadblocks and Unfinished Functionality

Discuss the issues you faced with creating your application. Provide possible solutions to these issues. What would you have done differently if you had to do this again? What did you not get finished?

For this project i was under a time constraint as i have many projects due in the same week this one is due. 

One issue i faced was trying to access output of the program. I had no password for the VNC window so i could not access the GUI. This was resolved when i emailed the lecturer.

One feature i would of wished to add was to upgrade the delete functionality with something else. I feel i could of added more.
